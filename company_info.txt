The Proposal Process
Our AI assistant is designed to provide you with an instant, personalized project proposal. Here is how it works:

The chatbot will guide you through a series of questions to understand your needs. This includes your contact details, company name, company size (e.g., 0-10, 10-100), and approximate project budget.

You will select a primary service and then a specific product from our list. If your need isn't listed, you can select "Others" to get a custom AI-generated estimate.

Once all details are confirmed, a professional proposal in PDF format is generated.

This detailed proposal, including a cost breakdown and any applicable discounts, is sent directly to your email inbox.

To start a new proposal at any time, simply click the "Start New Conversation" button in the sidebar.
